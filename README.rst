OakVar is a genomic variant analysis platform, based on OpenCRAVAT and further developed by Ryangguk Kim, the former lead architect of OpenCRAVAT.

OakVar uses the same commands as OpenCRAVAT. Thus, to use OakVar, OpenCRAVAT should be uninstalled first and then OakVar should be installed. The same `oc` commands will work. OavVar's own command `ov` will work just like `oc` at this moment.

For documentation, see `OakVar Documentation`_.
