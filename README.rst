OakCRAVAT uses the same commands as OpenCRAVAT. Thus, to use OakCRAVAT do `pip uninstall open-cravat` and `pip install oak-cravat`. The same `oc` commands will work.

Below is the readme of OpenCRAVAT:

 Open-CRAVAT is a python package that performs genomic variant interpretation including variant impact, annotation,                         
 and scoring.  It has a modular architecture with a wide variety of analysis modules that are developed both by
 the CRAVAT team and the broader variant analysis community. Open-CRAVAT is a product of the `Karchin Lab`_
 at Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with `In Silico Solutions`_ with funding provided by the National
 Cancer Institute's `ITCR`_ program.
